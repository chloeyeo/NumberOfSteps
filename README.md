The above is the question provided in HackerEarth for the 'Number Of Steps' problem.

In my solution I have added some additional print statements that:
1) asks the user the number of elements
2) asks the user the elements of arrayA - this is the array that we want to make its elements have the same value.
3) asks the user the elements of arrayB
After which the user will type in the corresponding values.

Finally there is another additional print statement telling the user that this is the number of steps taken,
before the required output is printed out, which is -1 or numberOfSteps.
